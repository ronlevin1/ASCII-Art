**Short description:**  
A Java-based application that converts images into ASCII art. This project is a solution for an Object-Oriented Programming course exercise at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI).

## Features
- 🔧 Converts images (like JPEG) into ASCII art.
- 🔧 Supports output to the console or an HTML file.
- 🔧 Handles various image resolutions and character sets.
- ⚙️ Written in Java.
- 🎯 The main goal is to apply OOP principles to create a flexible and extensible ASCII art generator.

## Demo / Screenshot
Example images can be found in the `examples` directory.
